President Obama, overseeing the regular Tuesday counterterrorism meeting of two dozen security officials in the White House Situation Room, took a moment to study the faces. It was Jan. 19, 2010, the end of a first year in office punctuated by terrorist plots and culminating in a brush with catastrophe over Detroit on Christmas Day, a reminder that a successful attack could derail his presidency.

Grant, Robert E. Lee, George S. Patton and David H. Petraeus. It is where President George W. Bush delivered what became known as his pre-emption speech, which sought to justify the invasion of Iraq, and where President Obama told the nation he was sending an additional 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan. Now at another critical moment in American military history, the faculty here on the commanding bend in the Hudson River is deep in its own existential debate. Narrowly, the argument is whether the counterinsurgency strategy used in Iraq and Afghanistan -- the troop-heavy, time-intensive, expensive doctrine of trying to win over the locals by building roads, schools and government -- is dead."

Pointedly recognizing ''that the right measures are not the same for each of us,'' the leaders of the Group of 8 nations, at a meeting hosted by Mr. Obama at Camp David, committed to ''take all necessary steps'' to strengthen their economies.

Russia and China, which have resisted voting against Sudan in the past, joined in the unanimous passage of the resolution. The resolution also called for both nations to remove their forces from Abyei, arguably the most iconic of numerous contested regions along the border. Last month, hostilities heated up when South Sudan captured the oil-rich region of Heglig from Sudan. It later withdrew, after Sudanese airstrikes and pressure from the international community, but clashes between the two nations continue along the border, as well as inside South Sudan's territory."
