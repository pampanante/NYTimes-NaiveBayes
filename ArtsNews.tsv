This is the second part of his ''Paradise Trilogy,'' the first of which was about a woman who goes in search of love as a sex tourist in Kenya."

This is the famously vexed Shakespeare comedy that can leave playgoers raising those same brows, perturbed by the sexual politics of a piece suggesting from its very title that women are there to be domesticated. Just how uncool is that? And yet, one look at Ms. Spiro and we know that she means business, as does the wonderful Simon Paisley Day playing the sparring partner-turned-husband, Petruchio, who in this ''cursed'' heroine recognizes from the start that he has met his match."

The adjudicators that year had unanimously awarded the prize to Hedd Wyn for an ''awdl'' (ode), called ''Yr Arwr'' (The Hero). The work was inspired by Percy Bysshe Shelley's ''Prometheus Unbound'' and has been described by Alan Llwyd, the contemporary poet and two-time winner of the chair, as ''a rich, complex, allegorical poem,'' which was ''possibly the most ambitious of any Eisteddfod winner of the 20th century.''"

Ideally, Mr. Pereira would have programmed a world premiere this summer as well, but because of time constraints, ''Die Soldaten'' (The Soldiers) by Bernd Alois Zimmermann was offered instead."

The staging might be said to mark the series' finally coming of age, for the opera was produced in partnership with the prestigious Rossini Opera Festival held in Pesaro, Rossini's birthplace here on the Adriatic Sea.The opera, first performed in Ferrara in 1812 when Rossini was only 20, is one of a series of Biblical operas that includes his ''Mosè in Egitto'' and Verdi's ''Nabucco.'' It relates -- with considerable license -- the Old Testament story of the siege by the Persian king Cyrus (Ciro) of Babylon, then ruled by Belshazzar (Baldassare), and the feast at which ''handwriting on the wall'' prophesied Baldassare's doom."

One followed a fast-paced, anything-goes approach that mixed serious and comic scenes, included bawdy humor and didn't worry about niceties of plot. The mixture of serious and comic elements gave these operas, which were cultivated primarily in 17th-century Venice, a kind of Shakespearean dimension.The second type attempted to make opera more respectable. Comic scenes were banned. Librettos took a loftier tone. The pace slowed down with longer arias and fewer of them. As with French Classical drama, fixed rules governed issues like the entrances and exits of characters. These operas originated in 18th-century Naples and spread widely. Handel's operas are essentially of this type, but as Italian operas written by a German for an English audience, they are sui generis. (French opera, by the way, was always a thing unto itself.)"

It's new, and it's by the man who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1979 for ''Buried Child.'' In that play he dealt with submerged secrets, and in ''Heartless'' dark secrets are at issue too, but Mr. Shepard is not simply playing in an old sandbox here. This writer known for many a testosterone-fueled battle (see ''True West,'' ''The Tooth of Crime'' and others) has -- perhaps surprisingly -- written a play predominantly populated by female characters. In ''Heartless'' Julianne Nicholson (''This'') plays Sally, an Angeleno with hidden truths that are likely to come to light, prompted by the arrival of a stranger to her family home. The cast also includes Jenny Bacon, Gary Cole, Betty Gilpin and Lois Smith, whose many credits include Halie, the hypocritical mother in the 1996 Broadway production of ''Buried Child.'' The director is the very busy Daniel Aukin (''4000 Miles,'' ''The Bad and the Better''). Previews begin Tuesday, opens Aug. 27, Irene Diamond Stage at the Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org; $25."

But then he went out into the countryside and found even more interesting materials: trees blown down in storms or struck by lightning, sometimes felled, or about to be, seemingly at the end of their lives. Out of these trunks and branches, working in locations around the world, he has in the last 40 years created a series of extraordinary and varied sculptures and installations, some that could last for hundreds of years and others already decayed, or in the process of decay, that will be reabsorbed into nature."

And it turns out that it was. Mr. Hallberg is injured, and Mr. Bokaer's ''Curtain,'' a collaboration with the visual artist Daniel Arsham, will take a different shape at its Pillow premiere on Wednesday. It's no less worth seeing, though. Mr. Bokaer's latest works have been striking for both their originality and their aesthetic impact, and the collaboration with Mr. Arsham promises a dramatic visual setting, with cast fiberglass molds that will melt during the performance, offering changing shapes as a living sculptural counterpoint to the dance. For the last-minute changes to the work obliged by Mr. Hallberg's injury, Mr. Bokaer has turned to Adam Weinert and James McGinn, dancers who have worked with him frequently, using them in the work's second half, ''Les Innocents,'' while performing alone in the opening section. 8:15 p.m. Wednesday to Saturday, Doris Duke Theater, Becket, Mass., (413) 243-0745, jacobspillow.org; $35 to 38."

Having written his last opera in 1829, the 64-year-old composer was sufficiently rejuvenated to compose again -- not opera, but the pieces he dubbed ''Sins of Old Age'' (''Péchés de Vieillesse''). The town never forgot his visit and in 1989 established a festival known as Rossini in Wildbad. The festival, which ended its 2012 festival on July 22, differs from its illustrious cousin, the Rossini Festival in the composer's birthplace of Pesaro, Italy, by allowing operas by Rossini's contemporaries to share the limelight. A few years ago it presented Meyerbeer's ''Semiramide'' -- a title well-known to Rossini fans -- and this year the nod went to the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante and the one opera, ''I Briganti,'' that he composed for Théâtre-Italien in Paris."

Recent shows devoted to his work have been on view at the Louvre in Paris and the Neue Galerie in New York. Now the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles is taking a new look at Messerschmidt. Its show -- ''Messerschmidt and Modernity'' -- which opens at the Getty Center on Tuesday, will present these mid-18th-century sculptures. But rather than explore Messerschmidt's work by itself, the exhibition will include modern and contemporary works that underscore his enduring influence. During the last 13 years of his life -- between 1770 and 1783 -- he produced a group of 69 so-called character heads, which he intended as a way of representing the spectrum of human emotion and which he either carved in alabaster or cast in a lead or tin alloy. Eight of them will be on view at the Getty, including the museum's ''Vexed Man.'' To illustrate Messerschmidt's influence, the show will also feature work by Tony Cragg, Bruce Nauman, Pierre Picot and Cindy Sherman. (310) 440-7300, getty.edu."

This three-day conference, which will feature talks on subjects ranging from hats and monarchs to the role of the Crown in a constitutional system, commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Queen's ascension to the throne as well as the recently completed renovation of the palace.

A prime example is the 1972 New York subway map, a masterpiece of visual ingenuity, which depicted the labyrinthine network as an orderly series of straight lines, all running at 45- or 90-degree angles from the stations. The hitch was that the map's designer had to ignore geographic reality in order to ''tidy up'' the tangled system. Some New Yorkers were outraged by the result, and voiced their concerns loudly.

And while it is closed for restoration, some of its choicest items are on the road. The itinerary brings 15 pictures to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in ''BELLINI, TITIAN AND LOTTO: NORTH ITALIAN PAINTINGS FROM THE ACCADEMIA CARRARA, BERGAMO.'' There are, of course, things by the superstars of the title. Giovanni Bellini's ''Pietà with the Virgin and Saint John,'' dated between 1455 and 1460, is a mournful complement to his later ''Madonna and Child,'' which is in the Met's collection. The single Titian is the very early ''Orpheus and Eurydice,'' thought to have been done between 1508 and 1512. And from Lorenzo Lotto we have a charming portrait of Lucina Brembati, who wears a large jeweled toothpick on a gold chain around her neck. Less familiar sights are three smallish narrative paintings from a Lotto altarpiece that has not traveled. And then there are artists you probably won't know at all, like Giovanni Cariani, Andrea Previtali, Moretto da Brescia and Vincenzo Foppa. But really, they're just old friends that you have yet to meet. Through Sept. 3; Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org."

She was a Belgian debut actress in a Belgian film about a factory girl turned out of her job, lost and alienated. It was a tough part, but she was in good hands: The film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes International Film Festival that year and she won the best actress prize. ''And what a joy to work with the brothers,'' Ms. Dequenne said. She gives another rare performance in Joachim Lafosse's ''Aimer à perdre la raison'' (Loving Without Reason), showing this year at Cannes in the section Un Certain Regard. She plays Murielle, a young woman who becomes trapped in her home by her husband and the cagey doctor who adopted him as a boy in Morocco.

A production of Dvorak's ''Rusalka,'' set in a bordello, drew vociferous audience reactions, but the staging had first been seen in Salzburg nearly four years before. Mr. Holten's initial production, Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' comes next season. But last week brought Verdi's autumnal masterpiece ''Falstaff'' in a production of eye-catching ingenuity by Robert Carsen. The action is transposed from Elizabethan times to the 1950s, a time that introduced a new Elizabeth and, according to a program note, embodied the opera's duality of a financially strapped aristocracy and a rising middle class."

A new production of his popular 1984 play, ''THE COMMON PURSUIT,'' gives audiences a chance to reassess his talent. Originally directed by Harold Pinter, a longtime collaborator and friend, the play is a generational comedy-drama that follows the lives of a half-dozen Cambridge students through two decades as they move through the worlds of literary London. The title refers to the literary magazine founded by one of the characters at school, and is a homage to a volume of essays by the esteemed British critic F. R. Leavis.

During his reign between 1444 and 1482, Federico da Montefeltro's marvelous edifice played host to as much intellectual and artistic activity as entire cities many times Urbino's size.

Indeed, the museum -- which offers more than 80 exhibitions a year -- set aside three full months for ''Deng Tuo Donated Treasures of Ancient Chinese Paintings,'' making it one of the longest shows in its history. Even so, the response was so overwhelming, with thousands of visitors per day, that the museum made the unusual decision to extend the exhibition, which opened in January, in reduced form through May 15. About a third of the works are now on view in seven top-floor galleries under the amended title ''Paintings of Ming and Qing Dynasties --Selections of Chinese Ancient Paintings Donated by Deng Tuo.''"

It is not a roller coaster veering through simulated landscapes of the Depression or coursing over virtual World War II battlefields.

The winning bid, which came by telephone, set a world record for any work of art offered at auction. It also helped raise total sales to $330.56 million, the highest ever at Sotheby's in this field. Not even Sotheby's specialists expected such a figure. The estimate quoted to me the day before by Simon Shaw, head of the New York department, was $80 million, plus the sale charge.
